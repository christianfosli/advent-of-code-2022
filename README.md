# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for this years [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## Unfinished disclaimer

Compared to [last year](https://github.com/christianfosli/advent-of-code-2021)
I now have a bit less time for myself outside of work to do these exercises.
I recently (July, 2022) became a dad :smile:. Which is awesome but also time
consuming :sweat_smile:
